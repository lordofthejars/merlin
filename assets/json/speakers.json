		"title":"Reactive web applications with AngularJS, Play, Akka & Cassandra",
		"abstract":"The combination of WebSockets with AngularJS is a fantastic stack for building reactive web applications - think constantly updating dashboards or a web based chat application. But what backend fits this model?<br><br>You guessed it: Play and Akka! This talk will take you through building the backend using the PlayFramework and Akka. The Actor model is perfect for reacting to events on the server side and pushing them to the client via a WebSocket. You’ll be shocked how simple this is to setup and get a basic application up and running.<br><br>We will be going through the KillrWeather application (https://github.com/killrweather/killrweather), which is an open source reference application for Apache Spark Streaming + Cassandra. Spark streaming is all about processing high volumes of data and building analytics on the fly, we’ll be showing how to get the processed data into a reactive front end."

		"title":"Java Caching API : JCache",
		"abstract":"Howdy Folks, let me tell you a story.<br><br>Once upon a time, we are talking about the year 2001, a few people had an amazing idea. They were thinking about something that would change the world, it would make the world easy and give programmers almost unlimited power! It was simply referred to as JSR 107, one of the only things to change in the journey of this JSR. These dreamers were way ahead of their time and nothing really happened. So time passed by and by and by and over the years it was buried in the deep catacombs of the JCP. Eventually, in 2011 two brave knights took on the fight and worked themselves through all the riddles, to complete their quest in 2014. You will know what I am talking about, they called it the Java Caching API or in short JCache.<br><br>A software system cannot possibly be imagined without Caching today and it was time for a standard. No matter if you want to cache Database, HTML or results of long running calculations, new systems have to reach a critical mass to be successful. Elevator pitch : JSR107 does for Caching what JDBC did for Database lock in. Now develop to JSR107 API and choose the Caching provider of your choice (Hazelcast, Oracle Coherence, Infinispan). Lets take a look together with coding samples."

If we strip back ActiveMQ to concentrate on its core functionality, add automatic sharding across clusters of brokers, add vert.x for its scalability and performance and sprinkle with magic from fabric8 - we have a highly scalable cloud based messaging solution ideal for the internet of things!"

If the demo gods are with us, then there will be live demos of this in action."
